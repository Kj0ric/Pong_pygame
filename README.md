# Pong_pygame
 
This is my first game project, V-PONG which stands for Vertical Pong.

It is actually funny because I misremember the original horizontal design and made it in a vertical fashion.

I used VS Code as the text editor. The reason why I chose VS Code was Github Copilot X and thankfully it has contributed to my experience gain in this project vastly. 

Now this is my version of Pong:
