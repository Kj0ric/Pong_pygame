# V-Pong
 
This is my first game project, V-PONG which stands for Vertical Pong.

It is actually funny because I misremembered the original horizontal design and made it in a vertical fashion.

<div align="center">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Pong.svg/1200px-Pong.svg.png" width="300" height="300"></td>
      <td><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/e6/11/1e/e6111e83dcf8f0a91b23fa6ae45c32e4.jpg" width="300" height="300"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>



I used VS Code as the text editor. The reason why I chose VS Code was Github Copilot X and thankfully it has contributed to my experience gain in this project vastly. 

Now this is my version of Pong: [See the demo video](/Images/demo.mov)
